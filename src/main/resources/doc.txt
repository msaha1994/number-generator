1. What is the Default Gateway in IP?

Ans-
A default gateway is the node in a computer network using the internet protocol suite that serves as the forwarding host (router) to other networks when no other route specification matches the destination IP address of a packet.

2. Explain the concepts of SNAT and DNAT

Ans-

Network Address Translation (NAT) occurs when one of the IP addresses in an IP packet header is changed.
In a SNAT, the destination IP address is maintained and the source IP address is changed.
Most commonly, a SNAT allows a host on the “inside” of the NAT, in an RFC 1918 IP address space, to initiate a connection to a host on the “outside” of the NAT.
A DNAT, by way of contrast, occurs when the destination address is changed and the source IP address is maintained. A DNAT allows a host on the “outside” to connect to a host on the “inside”.
In both cases, the NAT has to maintain a connection table which tells the NAT where to route returning packets. An important difference between a SNAT and a DNAT is that a SNAT allows multiple hosts on the “inside” to get to any host on the “outside”.
By way of contrast, a DNAT allows any host on the “outside” to get to a single host on the “inside”

Details of the IP assignments to be given to each node ;

4. Explain ARP.

Ans-
Most of the computer programs/applications use logical address (IP address) to send/receive messages, however
the actual communication happens over the physical address (MAC address) i.e from layer 2 of OSI model.
So our mission is to get the destination MAC address which helps in communicating with other devices.
This is where ARP comes into the picture, its functionality is to translate IP address to physical address.
